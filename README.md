## My process

I began by analyzing the design and setting up the project structure. I then wrote the HTML to structure the content semantically, followed by CSS to style the component and center it on the page. Finally, I refined the layout to match the design as closely as possible.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties

### What I learned

-   I was able to learn how to structure my page using the semantic HTML5 markup
-   I was able to apply a few CSS custom properties
-   The design guide were in JPG static format. Using the design JPGs as guides, I was able to use my best judgment for styles such as font-size, padding and margin.

### Continued development

-   Iâ€™d like to continue learning how to write clean, semantic HTML that improves accessibility and structure.
-   I want to continue improving my ability to create fully responsive components that adapt well to various screen sizes using CSS media queries and flexible layout techniques.
-   I want to develop better habits around file organization and naming conventions to keep my projects maintainable.
-   I want to sharpen my eye for design precision, focusing on replicating layouts as closely as possible to improve attention to detail.

### Useful resources

-   (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zutb5Clb_0Y&t=1123s) - This taught HTML in detail and greatly helped me gain valuable knowledge on HTML. I really liked the tutorial and will recommend it to anyone just starting off their web development journey.
